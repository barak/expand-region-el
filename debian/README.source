expand-region-el for Debian
---------------------------

Upstream is not yet giving version numbers, so I am using version of
the form "0+git.1.<comitid>" and "git export" to create a tarball.
There are submodules defined in the upstream git repo; these are used
for testing and are not included in the created tarball.
